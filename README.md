The 'Dataset' folder contains the datasets used in this study: [UNSW-NB15](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/z5025758_ad_unsw_edu_au/EnuQZZn3XuNBjgfcUu4DIVMBLCHyoLHqOswirpOQifr1ag?e=gKWkLS) & [TON_IoT](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/z5025758_ad_unsw_edu_au/EvBTaetotpdGnW7rJQ8fCvYBh8063CNeY9W33MpRsarJaQ?e=yZlnxW). For TON_IoT, only the network datasets were considered in this study.

The 'Data Generation' folder contains the datasets generated during this study using various oversampling methods, including SMOTE-NC, ADASYN, KMeans-SMOTE, B-SMOTE, CVAE, and CWGAN-GP. Two oversampling strategies were applied: minority-focused and balanced upsampling.

The 'Classification' folder contains the results of classifying datasets both before and after oversampling, using performance metrics appropriate for imbalanced data. The classifiers applied include Random Forest, XGBoost, 1D-CNN, and MLP, and multiclass classification was performed.
